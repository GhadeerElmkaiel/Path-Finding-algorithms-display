# Path-Finding-algorithms-display
visualization for some path finding algorithms.
for now this is just a notebook in which a Map class is defined.
using the Map class the user will be able to initialize a map with obstacles and a start and goal positions all randomly selected.
the user will be able to choose and visualize the progress of one of three path finding algorithms: (Dijkstra, A*, Potential field).
the user is able to choose the size of the map,and the number of the obstacles.

the class also offers the possibility to do a debugging process changing the debugging parameter while defining the class entity, or by using "set_debugging_mode" which allows the user to toggle the debugging mode.
